For Multiplayer Game, Tips:

Player-Logs stores the debug logs in build of the game, to test multiplayer
which can be found under resp locations according to platform, for windows:
%USERPROFILE%\AppData\LocalLow\CompanyName\ProductName\Player.log
this file will automaticly be updated in background, while the build is running as well
just need to refresh in file viewer to notice the changes, log entered newly...
Another easier work around, get Quantum Console, it paid asset, 
or get package through pirated website ;)

where as Animator and other visual components syncs are to be of Client Athenticated
